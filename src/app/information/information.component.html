        <p>Click on one or more squares until you see your total desired donation amount shows. Or <a href="https://secure.ifcj.org/site/Donation2?df_id=13044&13044.donation=form1&mfc_pref=T">you can also give using our standard donation form here</a>.</p>

        <p>Type in your details including your name, address, and payment information and click “Donate Now.”</p>

        <p>Once you have donated, the squares you chose and fulfilled will reveal a hidden image behind it. As other <em>Fellowship</em> friends join you in this ministry effort, more of the hidden image will be revealed to show the impact of your generosity and compassion.</p>
